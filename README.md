# Battlefront Launcher
A simple launcher for running Star Wars: Battlefront (Original) in your native monitor resolution (or any you specify really)

## Features
The launcher allows you to specify which resolution you want to run the game in (only applies to the game itself. Does not work with the game's menu)

You also have the option to skip the intro, run the game in windowed mode, and close the launcher on launch (well, when the game closes really.. ;))

## Building
To build, make sure you have Visual Studio 2013 or later. Express edition works just fine. Either open the solution file and build by pressing F6, or run the build.bat script.
